# Amsterdam-Airbnb-2019
An analysis on Airbnb Amsterdam properties data


This is a project done using Airbnb Amsterdam property listing data of 2019.
Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/code/beytullahuzun/airbnb-the-amsterdam-story-with-interactive-maps

The idea of the project is to understand what impacts the price of property. The analysis of simple variables like Rating, propertty's approximate distance from train station/airport/center(Rijskmuseum is considered) , number of people it can accomodate, number of bedrooms/bathrooms or any other variables available.

I have run correlation , Linear regression and clustering to understand the relationships between quantitative variables and dran conclusion based on it.
